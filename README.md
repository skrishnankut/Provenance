## Features

Hyperledger Fabric is a permissioned blockchain infrastructure, originally contributed by IBM and Digital Asset.

The primary difference between a permissioned blockchain network and an unpermissioned blockchain network is whether the participants in the network have an ability to restrict who can participate in the consensus mechanism of the blockchainâ€™s network.

A blockchain creates trust, traceability, and immutability through a peer-to-peer network. All transactions in the network, such as payments or event tracking in a supply chain, are confirmed by participants in the network. Thus, no central authority alone controls the validity of these events. These acknowledgments given by the participants lead to a consensus in the network, with which the data on the blockchain is continually persisted. So the majority of the participants decide whether a transaction is valid, instead of a single player. 
It is a more resilient, extensible and scalable blockchain platform suitable for enterprises.

# Hyperledger Fabric Provenance POC CI/CD Process

All the CI/CD configuration is prepared in Jenkins pipleline. 

## Jenkins Setup 

Before we begin integrating Hyperledger Fabric prjoect pipeline, we need to install three plugins:

1.) Node.js plugin, for node.js installations under jenkins user.  <br/>
2.) Gihub plugin, for integrating with Github.  <br/>
3.) Pipeline plugin, for congiguring pipeline stages.  <br/>

Note: After the plugins installation, we have to add new node.js installations in jenkins global tool configuration section.

## Environment Setup

### Step 1: Installing pre-requisites
To run Hypeledger Blockchain Platform, the below pre-requisites need to be installed on the platform on which you will be developing blockchain applications or operating Hyperledger Fabric.

Docker Engine	: Version 17.03 or higher <br/>
Docker-Compose	: Version 1.8 or higher <br/>
Node			: 8.9 or higher <br/>
npm				: v5.x <br/>
git				: 2.9.x or higher <br/>
Python			: 2.7.x <br/>


### Step 2: Install the CLI tools

There are a few useful CLI tools for Blockchain Platform developers. 

* composer-cli : Utility which contains all the essential operations.
* composer-rest-server : Utility for running a REST Server on your machine to expose your business networks as RESTful APIs.

### Step 3: Install Hyperledger Fabric

This step creates a local Hyperledger Fabric runtime to deploy business network application. 

	mkdir ~/fabric-dev-servers && cd ~/fabric-dev-servers
	curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/composer-tools/master/packages/fabric-dev-servers/fabric-dev-servers.tar.gz
	tar -xvf fabric-dev-servers.tar.gz
	cd ~/fabric-dev-servers
	./downloadFabric.sh
	
## Build
	
Before a business network definition can be deployed it must be packaged into a Business Network Archive (.bna) file. The composer archive create command is used to create a business network archive file from a business network definition folder on disk.
	
## Deploy Business Networks

Once the business network archive file has been created it can be deployed to a runtime using the composer runtime install command followed by a composer network start command.
